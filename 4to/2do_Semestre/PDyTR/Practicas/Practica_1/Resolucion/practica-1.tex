% IEEEtran V1.7 and later provides for these CLASSINPUT macros to allow the
% user to reprogram some IEEEtran.cls defaults if needed. These settings
% override the internal defaults of IEEEtran.cls regardless of which class
% options are used. Do not use these unless you have good reason to do so as
% they can result in nonIEEE compliant documents. User beware. ;)
%
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch}{1.0} % baselinestretch
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTinnersidemargin}{1in} % inner side margin
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUToutersidemargin}{1in} % outer side margin
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTtoptextmargin}{1in}   % top text margin
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTbottomtextmargin}{1in}% bottom text margin



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% The Computer Society requires 12pt.
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}


% For Computer Society journals, IEEEtran defaults to the use of 
% Palatino/Palladio as is done in IEEE Computer Society journals.
% To go back to Times Roman, you can use this code:
%\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ptm}\selectfont





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage[svgnames]{xcolor}
\hypersetup{
  colorlinks=false,
  linkbordercolor={white}
}

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.
%
% Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by 
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/acronym/


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/thumbpdf/


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
% *** IF USING HYPERREF BE SURE AND CHANGE THE EXAMPLE PDF ***

%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,pdftex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/breakurl/
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{document}
\title{Práctica 1\\Programación Distribuida y Tiempo Real}
%
%
% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%
%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

\author{Lucas Di Cunzolo}
\author{Santiago Tettamanti}
% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.


% The only time the second header will appear is for the odd numbered pages
% after the title page when using the twoside option.
% 
% *** Note that you probably will NOT want to include the author's ***
% *** name in the headers of peer review papers.                   ***
% You can use \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview for conditional compilation here if
% you desire.



% The publisher's ID mark at the bottom of the page is less important with
% Computer Society journal papers as those publications place the marks
% outside of the main text columns and, therefore, unlike regular IEEE
% journals, the available text space is not reduced by their presence.
% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:
%\IEEEpubid{0000--0000/00\$00.00~\copyright~2012 IEEE}
% or like this to get the Computer Society new two part style.
%\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{\hfill 0000--0000/00/\$00.00~\copyright~2012 IEEE}%
%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}
% Remember, if you use this you must call \IEEEpubidadjcol in the second
% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark (Computer Society journal
% papers don't need this extra clearance.)



% use for special paper notices
%\IEEEspecialpapernotice{(Invited Paper)}



% for Computer Society papers, we must declare the abstract and index terms
% PRIOR to the title within the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext IEEEtran
% command as these need to go into the title area created by \maketitle.
% As a general rule, do not put math, special symbols or citations
% in the abstract or keywords.
\IEEEtitleabstractindextext{%
\begin{abstract}

\end{abstract}

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.
\begin{IEEEkeywords}

\end{IEEEkeywords}}


% make the title area
\maketitle


% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext text will
% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
% here as \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext when compsoc mode
% is not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected - because compsoc
% conference papers position the abstract like regular (non-compsoc)
% papers do!
\IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext
% \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
% compsoc under a non-conference mode.


% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover
% page as needed:
% \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview
% \begin{center} \bfseries EDICS Category: 3-BBND \end{center}

En C, se utilizará la librería estándar \textbf{"socket.h"}, mientras que en Java,
se va a utilizarán los paquetes \textbf{"java.net"}, aunque utilizando ciertos
paquetes para la interacción con el socket, provenientes de la librería
\textbf{"java.io"}, utilizando las clases \textbf{InputStream} y \textbf{OutputStream}

\subsection{Similitudes y diferencias entre C y Java}
Como primera y más grande diferencia entre ambos lenguajes, se puede remarcar la diferenciación
entre "socket cliente" y "socket servidor", planteado por la librería de java. Lo que no sucede en C.

Para iniciar un socket en java, en modo servidor, se utiliza la clase \textbf{ServerSocket}, mientras que para iniciar uno en modo cliente, se utiliza la clase \textbf{Socket}.

En C, ambas creaciones quedan bajo la responsabilidad de la función \textbf{Socket()}, solo que para diferenciar el socket, el servidor debe "bindear" y quedarse a la espera de datos. Esto lo hace usando \textbf{Bind()} y \textbf{Listen()} respectivamente.

El cliente, se conectará a un socket utilizando la función \textbf{Connect()}

\section{Punto 2}
\textit{Tanto en C como en Java (directorios csock-javasock)}
\subsection{Inciso A}
\textit{¿Por qué puede decirse que los ejemplos no son representativos del modelo c/s?}

En cliente-servidor el servidor está continuamente esperando alguna conexion por parte de algún cliente, en este caso el servidor cierra la conexion al recibir el primer request y enviar la respuesta. El cliente no usa la respuesta recibida por el servidor, en cambio el servidor si usa lo enviado por el cliente y realiza acciones con esos datos que no tienen que ver con la respuesta a la petición (aunque se sobreentiende que es para mostrar el ejemplo).
Tampoco se respetan los pasos de conexión: inicialización, envío/recepción de peticiones y finalización; en el ejemplo solo le hace el segundo paso, no existe handshake con el servidor o mensajes de finalización de conexión. Es más un ejemplo de conexión entre procesos usando sockets que de client/servidor puro.

\subsection{Inciso B}
\textit{Muestre que no necesariamente siempre se leen/escriben todos los datos involucrados en
las comunicaciones con una llamada read/write con sockets.}
\subsubsection{csock}
Se modificó el programa para aceptar varios tamaños de buffer (Ver apéndice A)
Para probarlo rápidamente, se presenta la regla en make, lo que generará clientes y servidores que envian y reciben bytes

En este caso, la cantidad máxima de caracteres que se llegaron a leer fue de 

\lstinputlisting[language=bash]{code-examples/make_example}

\subsubsection{javasock}
\subsection{Inciso C}
\textit{Agregue a la modificación anterior una verificación de llegada correcta de los datos que se
envían (cantidad y contenido del buffer), de forma tal que se asegure que todos los datos
enviados llegan correctamente, independientemente de la cantidad de datos
involucrados.}
\subsubsection{csock}
\subsubsection{javasock}

\subsection{Inciso D}
\textit{Grafique el promedio y la desviación estándar de los tiempos de comunicaciones de cada
comunicación. Explique el experimento realizado para calcular el tiempo de
comunicaciones.}\\\\
Para este punto, se plantea calcular los tiempos de la comunicaciónes, esto quiere decir,
el tiempo que tarda el cliente en establecer la conexión con el servidor, una vez establecida,
se contempla el envío de los datos por parte del cliente, y la recepción por parte del servidor.
Una vez terminado todo este flujo, se puede dar por concluída la comunicación.

El contéo del tiempo se realizó del lado del \textbf{cliente}.\\
Para tomar los datos para realizar el promedio y la desviación estándar de cada tamaño de buffer,
se cuenta con un script en el mismo directorio de csock llamado \textit{get\_data}
Dicho script ejecutara repetídas veces la conexión cliente-servidor y volcará los tiempos en un archivo
en el mismo directorio, llamado \textbf{buffer\_[BUFFER\_SIZE]\_data}, donde \textbf{BUFFER\_SIZE} es el tamaño
del buffer con el que se corrió dicho script.

El script acepta 2 paŕametros:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cantidad de iteraciones a realizar - Por defecto en 10
  \item Tamaño del buffer a testear - Por defecto en $10^{3}$
\end{enumerate}

En el \hyperref[appendixC]{apéndice C}, se pueden encontrar archivos de datos de buffers de tamaños
$10^{3}$, $10^{4}$, $10^{5}$ y $10^{6}$

\section{Punto 3}
\textit{¿Por qué en C se puede usar la misma variable tanto para leer de teclado como para
enviar por un socket? ¿Esto sería relevante para las aplicaciones c/s?}
\subsection{Comunicación mediante sockets\\Tipos}
En un programa C, para el envío de datos por un socket, se puede utilizar cualquier variable de tipo puntero.
Con esto, se entiende que se puede utilizar hasta la misma variable que se utilizó para leer desde teclado
(tipi char*).\\
Todo puntero en C, puede utilizarse de dos maneras.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Manera estática:
  \lstinputlisting[language=C]{code-examples/static-mem.c}
  Manejando memoria de manera estática, nos ahorramos el alocado de la memoria
  previo al uso, simplificando el código.
  Las principales desventajas son que si se necesita más de 256 caracteres, va a ser necesario
  cambiar de variable, y que de utilizar solamente 1 caracter, se tiene \textbf{siempre} alocado
  para 256 caracteres.
  La alternatica es utilizar memoria dinámica.\\

  \item Manera dinámica:
  \lstinputlisting[language=C]{code-examples/dynamic-mem.c}

  En este caso va a ser necesario llamar a alguna de las funcionas para alocado de memoria antes
  de utilizar la variable. De no hacer, generará errores.
  
  La principal ventaja de utilizar memoria de esta manera, es la posibilidad de realocar su espacio
  en cualquier momento.
  
  Como principal desventaja es que se le complejidad al código.
\end{itemize}

Luego, el socket acepta como buffer una variable de tipo \textbf{void*}, lo que significa que se le puede
enviar un puntero a cualquier tipo. El mayor problema que puede taer esto es que, como son bytes,
el cliente no sepa como interpretarlos.

\section{Punto 4}

\textit{¿Podría implementar un servidor de archivos remotos utilizando sockets?\\Describa
brevemente la interfaz y los detalles que considere más importantes del diseño.}\\

No solo sería posible, sino que ya existen 2 protocolos para envio de archivos por la red.

Estos protocolos se diferencian en, orientado a la conexion \textbf{FTP} o no orientado a la
conexion \textbf{TFTP}.

\subsection{FTP}
Un servidor FTP se podría implementar utilizando 2 sockets para el servidor, uno utilizado para los datos,
y otro utilizado para el control. (Puertos 20 y 21 en el estándar, respectivamente).
Ambos socket deben ser del tipo TCP.\\
Se cuenta con instrucciónes específicas (muy similares a las de linux) para el uso de los archivos, como por ejemplo:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{ls:} Lista los archivos.
  \item \textbf{cd:} Cambia de directorio.
  \item \textbf{close:} Cierra la conexión con el servidor remoto (TCP FIN).
  \item \textbf{delete:} Elimina un archivo.
  \item \textbf{get:} Baja un archivo.
  \item \textbf{mkdir:} Crea un directorio.
\end{itemize}
Entre otras instrucciones.\\
\textit{Todas las acciones se ejecutan \textbf{sobre} el filesystem del servidor remoto FTP.}


\subsection{TFTP}
Un servidor TFTP utiliza solamente un socket, para realizar la conexión, del tipo UDP.
Cuenta con un conjunto de instrucciones mucho más reducido que el servidor FTP.

\subsection{Implementación propia}
Para la implementación de un servidor, utilizaría 

\section{Punto 5}
\textit{Defina qué es un servidor con estado (\textbf{stateful server}) y qué es un servidor sin estado
(\textbf{stateless server}).}\\

\subsection{Servidor con estado}
Un servidor con estado, es aquel que recuerda el estado en el que habia quedado el sistema
en la anterior conexión de un cliente, sin la necesidad de mantener la conexión.
Esto quiere decir, por ejemplo, un servidor con estado es aquel que puede mantener una 
página web por ejemplo.

\subsection{Servidor sin estado}
Un servidor sin estado, es aquel que no almacena el estado entre conexiones de un cliente.
Esto quiere decir, que el servidor \textbf{siempre} arranca en el mismo estado para todas las
conexiones.
